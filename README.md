A Goodreads Library Of LOved (& Hated) Books

This project shall be an attempt at me compiling all the many books that I have read over the years. The purpose of it is to also keep track of new books that I shall read in the future. I'm unsure of whether I'll be able to implement everything I have in mind, but I'm looking forward to trying.

Update 05/04/2022
The project is unfinished at the moment. I need to research some more into prototypes and learn the local storage option so that I cxan figure out how to implement the adding of books. Once i can do this, I will update my table to include delete buttons, and perhaps dynamically changing ratings and date added as in Goodreads.

That means I'm choosing to pause the project at this point, because I sense that there's some knowledge I need that will be crucial to completeting the project. I should come back to this hopefully by the end of the month.
