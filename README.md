A Goodreads Library Of LOved (& Hated) Books 

This project shall be an attempt at me compiling all the many books that I have read over the years. The purpose of it is to also keep track of new books that I shall read in the future. I'm unsure of whether I'll be able to implement everything I have in mind, but I'm looking forward to trying.
